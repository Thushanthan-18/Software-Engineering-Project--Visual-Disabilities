##About This Project
This was a group project which we had to do for my Software Engineering Module. The main aim of doing this project was in order to make
a project which would be used by students that have visual disability such as partial or complete blindness. 
We used a software which is called HEAT Integrated Development Environment for the Haskell programming language. This is one of the 
IDE that was specifically developed for teaching purposes and everything within HEAT is written in Java.

Our group had 4 members and each member was responsible to do atleast One feature. 
1st member = SplashScreen
2nd member = High Contrast Mode
3rd member = Text to Speech
4th member = Magnifier

Myself, I worked on the Splashscreen and the buttons after the splashscreen and also intergrating each button with the correct editor.
There are two buttons that could be clicked. 
First button is named Default Mode. Default Mode is for users/students that do not have any sort of visual disability. On the other hand,
the second button is named Accessibility Mode. This is for users/students that have complete/partial visual disability. 
When clicked on the Default Mode, it would go to the HEAT editor with no modifications.. just with default settings. However, if you 
click on accessibility mode it would go on HEAT editor with all the features that we have added.
