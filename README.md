HEAT IDE Accessibility Enhancements
Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a Software Engineering module, focusing on creating an inclusive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tailored for students with visual impairments, including partial or complete blindness. The HEAT IDE, a Java-based platform originally designed for teaching Haskell programming, was extended with accessibility-focused features to ensure equitable usability for all learners.

**Key Features**
The following enhancements were implemented to improve accessibility and user experience:

1.**Splash Screen & Mode Selection**

A dynamic splash screen with two primary interaction modes:

**Default Mode:** Launches the standard HEAT IDE interface for users without visual impairments.

**Accessibility Mode:** Activates all accessibility features (listed below) to accommodate students with partial or complete blindness.

Seamless integration with the HEAT editor ensures smooth transitions between modes.

**High Contrast Mode**

Optimizes visibility through increasing the Icons size and increasing the text size.

**Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration**

Would be able to read out loud anything that is written within the editor and highlighted.

**Magnifier Tool**

Dynamically enlarges text and interface components to support users with low vision.

**Development Team & Contributions
**
This collaborative effort involved four team members, each responsible for a core feature:

**Splash Screen & Mode Selection:** Designed the splash screen interface, implemented mode-switching logic, and integrated buttons with the HEAT editor.

**High Contrast Mode:** Developed customizable theme adjustments.

**Text-to-Speech:** Integrated TTS functionality for auditory feedback.

**Magnifier:** Built a scalable UI magnification tool.

**Technical Details**
**Platform:** HEAT IDE (Java-based Haskell programming environment).

**Focus:** Accessibility-first design principles, ensuring compliance with inclusive education standards.

**Integration:** Modular implementation allows features to be toggled dynamically via the Accessibility Mode.
